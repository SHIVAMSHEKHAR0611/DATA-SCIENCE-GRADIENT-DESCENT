# DATA-SCIENCE-GRADIENT-DESCENT
Implementing Gradient Descent and Normalization in following tasks

------------------
- BOSTON DATASET -
------------------

=> Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.
You are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. Your task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.

------------------------------
- COMBINES BYCLE POWER PLANT -
------------------------------

=> Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
